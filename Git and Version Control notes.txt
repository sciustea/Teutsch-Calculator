Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later

very important if you're a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you most certainly want to); a Version Control System(VCS) is a very wise thing to use; it allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. It also means if you lose files, you can recover.

Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.

To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.
